## [UX](#ux)

### [Project Goals](#project)

The main goal of Bitcoin Basic is to provide information about Bitcoin that is easy to understand, so that a newcomer will leave the site with a solid foundational knowledge of what Bitcoin is, it's current rate and where they can find more in depth information if they want to learn more. It will be a fully responsive website, with a minimalist design and a logical easy to follow structure.

#### [Visitor Goals](#visitor)

the target audience for this website is a user that is not necessarily technical, who has recently heard about bitcoin and wants:

- To know more about what it is and how to start using it.
- To know the initial steps to take when first using bitcoin.
- Clear visuals that don't confuse or overwhelm the visitor.
- Intuitive page layout and navigation.
- To know where they can find further reading and more in-depth information.
- To see the current market rates of Bitcoin against various currencies.
- To see current news on Bitcoin.

#### [Developer Goals](#developer)

As a developer the aim is to create a web application that will:

- Enable a visitor to find the answers to most of the questions a newcomer to Bitcoin will have.
- Be responsive, interactive and dynamic using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and where necessary jQuery and/or API's in design, development and implementation.
- Be a great addition to the portfolio.

#### [User Stories](#user)

As a newcomer to Bitcoin, with little to no technical knowledge, I want:

1. A clear guide with the key information I need to understand what Bitcoin is.
2. Clear navigation to easily maneuver through the site.
3. The ability to compare the value of Bitcoin to various fiat currencies.
4. To see the current price of Bitcoin.
5. To be able to see the latest news to give context about Bitcoin.
6. To have the ability to send the questions I have about Bitcoin.

As someone who has more knowledge about Bitcoin, I want:

1. The ability to go directly to the information that I require about the current price of Bitcoin.
2. Information on further/ more advanced information on Bitcoin.
3. A resource that I can direct new enquirers about Bitcoin to.
4. To see the latest developments in Bitcoin.
5. The ability to provide feedback about further improvements that can be made on the site to meet needs as an invested Bitcoin follower.

#### [Design](#design)

Bitcoin can easily become overwhelming to a newcomer who may not have looked at the financial market before, let alone cryptocurrency! Keeping that in mind the design choices have been made to interfere as little as possible with the main subject matter.

##### Colours

The main colours used in this project for the logo, buttons and font was the main colour of the Bitcoin Logo: rgb(255, 153, 0);

This contrasted well against black and white and added enough interest to the design without making it too distracting.

##### Font

<img src="C:\Users\diamo\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210221235318159.png" alt="image-20210221235318159" style="zoom:33%;" />

The font chosen was Roboto because it has a clean, modern type that would go well with the minimalist theme.

##### Icons

The icons used on the landing page were chosen to emphasise meaning and make it obvious, at a glance, where that navigation button leads to.

##### Styles

As there are only a few elements on each page, the hover effect on the buttons directed the visitor to it's function but also added dynamism.

## [Features](#features)

#### [Existing Features](#existing)

1. ##### Landing Button Navigation Page

   - On arrival at the site, the visitor will see a group of 5 navigation buttons, which are in place of the navbar. The layout of the buttons are responsive, and will depend on the screen size you are using. 

     Up to max width 991px:

   ![Small Landing page Layout](assets/images/read-me/landing-page-small.png)

   

   â€‹		Min width 992px and above:

   ![Large Landing page layout](assets/images/read-me/landing-page-lrg.png)

   - There is a smooth transition effect added if you change your screen size.
   - From this landing page you can choose to go to the beginners guide or directly check the market price, monthly Bitcoin chart or the latest news if you are not a beginner.

2. ##### A guide on how to get started with Bitcoin

   - The accordion component allows the information in the guide to be displayed whilst  keeping the layout clutter free.

     ![Closed Accordion](assets/images/read-me/accordion-closed.png)

   - This feature also allows the visitor to go straight to a particular part of the guide rather than being forced to read it all.

   - The pale background colour of the open section makes it clear that section is open.

     ![Open Accordion](assets/images/read-me/accordion-open.png)

3. ##### Interactive table of market rates

   - Using [CoinDesk API](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin) visitors can select checkboxes next to their required currencies and display the current rates in a table. 

     ![Country Code Checkboxes](assets/images/read-me/market-rates-checkboxes.png)

   - They can also click the 'Select All' button to display all currency rates in the table

     ![Country Code Checkboxes](assets/images/read-me/market-rates-table.png)

   - This feature gives the visitor complete control over the information they want to view

4. ##### Updating chart of Bitcoin from the past month

   - Using [CoinDesk API](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin) visitors can see an updating chart of the last 31 days of the price of Bitcoin

   - This allows them to easily see how Bitcoin is trending and it's current price as it relates to the price on a particular day in the last month.

   - As this chart is updating daily, it remains a useful resource that visitors can come back to.

     ![Country Code Checkboxes](assets/images/read-me/chart.png)

5. ##### Updating  Bitcoin news articles

   - Using [Messari.io API](https://messari.io/) visitors can click the title links to see current news articles for Bitcoin.

   - The articles are updating regularly, which gives visitors a reason to return to the site.

     ![News Articles](assets/images/read-me/news-image.png)

6. ##### Email success/error modal

   - The visitor has the ability to send an email message in the contact form, which needs to meet validation requirements before it can be sent.

   - If the form is filled out incorrectly, feedback is given in an error modal so that the visitor can amend the details.

     ![Error Modal](assets/images/read-me/error-modal.png)

   - When the email has been sent successfully, feedback is given in a success modal so that the visitor knows the message was sent.

     ![Success Modal](assets/images/read-me/success-modal.png)

#### [Features Left To Implement](#featuresLeft)

1. ##### Calculator

   - Currently the Market Rates page shows the current price of 1 Bitcoin in a particular currency. In future a calculator feature that would allow visitors to see the price of any amount of Bitcoin in their chosen currency would be a useful tool. For example, a visitor could find out how much $50 is worth in Bitcoin and what the price of 3 Bitcoin is in Dollars.

2. ##### Current price of Bitcoin on every page

   - It would be useful for visitors to be able to instantly see the current price of Bitcoin on every page, rather than having to go to the Market Rates page. 

3. ##### Charts of different time spans

   - Having the ability to see how the price of Bitcoin has changed over a range of time spans i.e. 24 hours, 7 days, 1 year would give the visitor a more informed view of Bitcoin overall.
